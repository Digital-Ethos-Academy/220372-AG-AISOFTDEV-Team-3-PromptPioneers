AI-Powered Requirement Analyzer - High-Level Idea
Project Overview
The AI-Powered Requirement Analyzer is an intelligent web application that transforms vague, informal problem statements into comprehensive, professional Product Requirements Documents (PRDs). It acts as a virtual product manager, helping startups, development teams, and product owners rapidly convert their ideas into structured, actionable requirements.

Core Problem Statement
Many software projects fail or experience significant delays because of poorly defined requirements. Stakeholders often have brilliant ideas but struggle to articulate them in a structured, developer-friendly format. Writing comprehensive PRDs is time-consuming and requires expertise that many early-stage teams don't have in-house.

Solution
An interactive web application that:

Accepts informal input - Users can describe their idea in plain language, just like explaining it to a colleague
Analyzes and expands - The AI intelligently identifies gaps, asks clarifying questions, and suggests features
Generates structured documentation - Produces a complete PRD with user stories, acceptance criteria, technical considerations, and success metrics
Provides iterative refinement - Allows users to review and refine the generated requirements through conversation
Key Features
1. Multi-Input Problem Statement Capture

Text input for typed descriptions
Voice-to-text capability for natural brainstorming
File upload for existing notes or documents
URL import from issue trackers or collaboration tools
2. Intelligent Requirement Extraction

Identifies stakeholders and user personas automatically
Extracts functional and non-functional requirements
Detects implicit requirements based on industry best practices
Flags ambiguities and asks targeted clarifying questions
3. Comprehensive PRD Generation

Executive summary and project goals
Detailed user personas with demographics and pain points
User stories in standard format (As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit])
Acceptance criteria for each user story
Technical requirements and constraints
Success metrics and KPIs
Timeline and milestone suggestions
4. Interactive Refinement Chat

Conversational interface for iterating on requirements
Ability to add, modify, or remove specific sections
Suggestion mode for feature enhancements
Risk assessment and feasibility analysis
5. Export & Integration

Download PRD as Markdown, PDF, or Word document
Export user stories to JSON for import into project management tools
Generate Jira/GitHub Issues directly from user stories
Version control for requirement changes
Target Users
Startup Founders - Need to document MVP requirements quickly
Product Managers - Want to accelerate the PRD writing process
Development Team Leads - Need to translate stakeholder requests into technical specs
Consultants - Require rapid requirement gathering for client projects
