    "# Day 6 - Lab 1: Building RAG Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Build a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system orchestrated by LangGraph, scaling in complexity from a simple retriever to a multi-agent team that includes a grader and a router.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 180 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "Welcome to Day 6! Today, we build one of the most powerful and common patterns for enterprise AI: a system that can answer questions about your private documents. We will use LangGraph to create a 'research team' of AI agents. Each agent will have a specific job, and LangGraph will act as the manager, orchestrating their collaboration to find the best possible answer.\n",

    "\n",
    "We need several libraries for this lab. `langgraph` is the core orchestrator, `langchain` provides the building blocks, `faiss-cpu` is for our vector store, and `pypdf` is for loading documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Selection:**\n",
    "For RAG and agentic workflows, models with strong instruction-following and reasoning are best. `gpt-4.1`, `o3`, or `gemini-2.5-pro` are excellent choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helper Functions Used:**\n",
    "- `setup_llm_client()`: To configure the API client.\n",
    "- `load_artifact()`: To read the project documents that will form our knowledge base."

    "### Challenge 1 (Foundational): A Simple RAG Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Build a simple LangGraph with two nodes: one to retrieve documents and one to generate an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** Think of `AgentState` as the shared 'whiteboard' for your agent team. Every agent (or 'node' in the graph) can read from and write to this state, allowing them to pass information to each other as they work on a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  Define the state for your graph using a `TypedDict`. It should contain keys for `question` and `documents`.\n",
    "2.  Create a \"Retriever\" node. This is a Python function that takes the state, uses the `retriever` to get relevant documents, and updates the state with the results.\n",
    "3.  Create a \"Generator\" node. This function takes the state, creates a prompt with the question and retrieved documents, calls the LLM, and stores the answer.\n",
    "4.  Build the `StateGraph`, add the nodes, and define the edges (`RETRIEVE` -> `GENERATE`).\n",
    "5.  Compile the graph and invoke it with a question about your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Quality:** A functional graph that can answer a simple question (e.g., \"What is the purpose of this project?\") by retrieving context from the project artifacts."

    "**Task:** Build a sophisticated \"research team\" of specialized agents that includes a router to delegate tasks to the correct specialist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1.  **Specialize your retriever:** Create two separate retrievers. One for the PRD (`prd_retriever`) and one for the technical documents (`tech_retriever` for schema and ADRs).\n",
    "2.  **Define the Agents:**\n",
    "    * `ProjectManagerAgent`: This will be the entry point and will act as a router. It uses an LLM to decide whether the user's question is about product requirements or technical details, and routes to the appropriate researcher.\n",
    "    * `PRDResearcherAgent`: A node that uses the `prd_retriever`.\n",
    "    * `TechResearcherAgent`: A node that uses the `tech_retriever`.\n",
    "    * `SynthesizerAgent`: A node that takes the collected documents from either researcher and synthesizes a final answer.\n",
    "3.  **Build the Graph:** Use conditional edges to orchestrate the flow: The entry point is the `ProjectManager`, which then routes to either the `PRD_RESEARCHER` or `TECH_RESEARCHER`. Both of those nodes should then route to the `SYNTHESIZE` node, which then goes to the `END`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Quality:** A highly advanced agentic system that mimics a real-world research workflow, including a router and specialist roles, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the RAG process."

    "\n",
    "Incredible work! You have now built a truly sophisticated AI system. You've learned how to create a knowledge base for an agent and how to use LangGraph to orchestrate a team of specialized agents to solve a complex problem. You progressed from a simple RAG chain to a system that includes quality checks (the Grader) and intelligent task delegation (the Router). These are the core patterns for building production-ready RAG applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Takeaway:** LangGraph allows you to define complex, stateful, multi-agent workflows as a graph. Using nodes for agents and conditional edges for decision-making enables the creation of sophisticated systems that can reason, delegate, and collaborate to solve problems more effectively than a single agent could alone."
